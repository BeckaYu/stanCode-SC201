# stanCode-SC201: Artificial Intelligence
Hello, I'm Rebecca Yu 👋

## 👩‍💻 About Me
In May 2023, I shifted gears from Product Management to aspiring Data Analyst, immersing myself in Python through stanCode's rich curriculum. My sights are set on breaking into the U.S. data scene, with plans to apply to an MSBA program in 2024.

## 💛 My Journey
I have conquered [SC001](https://github.com/BeckaYu/stanCode-SC001.git) and [SC101](https://github.com/BeckaYu/stanCode-SC101.git) courses, giving me skills similar to what's taught in Stanford's CS106B. My educational quest continues with an exciting lineup in the courses of SC201: Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP with Deep Learning. Stay tuned for updates on my learning milestones!
